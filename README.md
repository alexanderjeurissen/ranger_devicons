# File icons for the Ranger file manager

This plugin introduces a new linemode that prefixes file names with a file icon

## Prerequisites
This plugin uses glyphs from a patched NERDfont. So in order for this plugin to work you need to
install a NERDfont and set it as the default font for your terminal.

I personally use the Source Code Pro patched NERDfont(this is also the font displayed in the
screenshot), this and other NERDfonts and the install instructions for these fonts can be found in
the following repository: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts

## Install instructions
Ranger has added support for loading directories in the plugins folder which makes it easier to install and keep plugins updated.
To install, just clone the repo into the plugins folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexanderjeurissen/ranger_devicons ~/.config/ranger/plugins/ranger_devicons
```

Then execute the following `echo "default_linemode devicons" >> $HOME/.config/ranger/rc.conf` (or wherever your `rc.conf` is located).

## Configuration
This plugin can be configured by setting environment variables (e.g. in your
`~/.profile`). Currently, only one option is available:

- `RANGER_DEVICONS_SEPARATOR` (default `" "`, i.e. a single space): The
  separator between icon and filename. Some terminals use the adjacent space to
  display a bigger icon, in which case this can be set to two spaces instead.
